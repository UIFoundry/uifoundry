# Product Roadmap

## Primary Roadmap Location

**The authoritative project roadmap is maintained in the [README.md](../../README.md#roadmap) file.**

This serves as the public showcase of development progress and should be the primary reference for all agents and contributors.

## Roadmap Management Instructions

### For Agents:

- **Always reference the README.md roadmap** when planning features or checking progress
- **Update the README.md roadmap** when completing tasks or changing priorities
- **Mark items as completed** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` in the README
- **Update block counts** in the marketing blocks checklist (e.g., "Hero (1/5+)" when completing variants)
- **Keep this file in sync** if making significant structural changes to the roadmap

### Current Focus Areas (as of latest sync):

- **Phase 0**: Completing marketing blocks (5+ variants each) with registry distribution and documentation
- **Phase 1**: Multi-site architecture and role-based access control
- **Phase 2**: Custom domains, LLM site builders, and subscription management
- **Phase 3**: Advanced form builder with dynamic creation capabilities

### Why README.md is Primary:

- Public showcase of progress for potential customers and contributors
- Single source of truth that prevents documentation drift
- Immediate visibility of what's being built and what's completed
- Professional presentation of project status and direction
