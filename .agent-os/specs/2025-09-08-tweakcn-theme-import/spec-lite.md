# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement the ability to import custom shadcn/ui themes generated from tweakcn.com into UIFoundry sites by pasting CSS theme code directly into the PayloadCMS admin panel. The system uses regex parsing to extract CSS variables and automatically populate matching TailwindConfig color fields with validation, live preview, and rollback capabilities to safely customize site appearance while maintaining compatibility with existing blocks.
