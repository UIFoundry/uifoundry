# Spec Summary (Lite)

Create a comprehensive, repeatable process for adding new components to the UIFoundry custom shadcn registry, enabling systematic analysis of registry structure, import pattern transformations, component migration procedures, metadata configuration, and testing validation. This will standardize how agents add PayloadCMS blocks, fields, globals, and UI components to the registry for distribution via shadcn CLI.
