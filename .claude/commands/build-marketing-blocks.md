# Build Marketing Blocks

Build a batch of marketing blocks (1-5 at a time) through the complete 3-phase pipeline: Source & Build, Registry Migration, and Documentation.

This workflow ensures components are never written from scratch - they're always sourced from MIT-licensed shadcn ecosystem resources.

**IMPORTANT**: All components must include source attribution comments and be tracked in the centralized sources document (`agent-os/standards/component-sources.md`).

Refer to the instructions located in this file:
