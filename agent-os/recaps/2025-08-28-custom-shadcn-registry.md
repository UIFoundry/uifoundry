# [2025-08-28] Recap: Custom Shadcn Registry

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-custom-shadcn-registry/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented the foundational infrastructure for UIFoundry's custom shadcn component registry, establishing the API endpoints, TypeScript interfaces, and folder structure needed for developers to install premium components via the shadcn CLI. The implementation includes:

- Complete REST API endpoints (`/api/registry/index.json`, `/api/registry/[component].json`, `/api/registry/components`) with proper shadcn CLI compatibility
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for registry components, metadata, and API responses
- Organized registry folder structure under `/registry/` for component files
- Utility functions for component loading and management
- Error handling and proper HTTP headers for API responses
- Required dependencies (@shadcn/ui, react-syntax-highlighter) installed and configured

## Updates (3.6 & 4)

- Validated component import paths for ~ alias; updated validator to accept ~ and utils/ui paths
- Implemented web interface under /registry (list, detail, syntax highlighting, install command)
- Live previews blocked pending full conversion and typing of components (3.3â€“3.5)

## Context

Implement a custom shadcn component registry for UIFoundry that allows developers to install premium components via `npx shadcn add --registry https://uifoundry.com/registry component-name`. The registry will serve component metadata, files, and dependencies through API endpoints while providing a web interface for component discovery and previews.
