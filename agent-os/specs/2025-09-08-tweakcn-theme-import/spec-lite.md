# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement tweakcn theme import functionality by creating a new SiteConfig global that manages theme selection and import. Users can paste CSS theme code which gets parsed and automatically creates new Theme records in the existing Themes collection. The system provides a dropdown interface for switching between multiple themes while maintaining a single active theme site-wide, with live preview and validation capabilities.
