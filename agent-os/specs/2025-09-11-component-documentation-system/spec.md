# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Component Documentation System
> Created: 2025-09-11

## Overview

Create a comprehensive MDX documentation system in /content/docs for all UIFoundry core components, leveraging Fumadocs for interactive documentation with live code examples, admin panel integration, and developer guides for custom block creation.

## User Stories

### Developer Using Registry Components

As a developer, I want to find and install UIFoundry components through clear documentation, so that I can quickly integrate blocks, fields, and UI components into my PayloadCMS projects.

Developers need step-by-step registry setup guides, component installation commands, and TypeScript definitions to understand how to configure and customize each component in their projects.

### Content Creator Using PayloadCMS Admin

As a content creator, I want to understand what each block and field does through visual examples and configuration guides, so that I can effectively build pages using the PayloadCMS admin interface.

Content creators need screenshots of admin interfaces, descriptions of field purposes, default value explanations, and links to live examples showing the frontend output.

### Developer Building Custom Blocks

As a developer extending UIFoundry, I want detailed guides for creating custom blocks, fields, and globals, so that I can maintain consistency with the existing architecture and contribute to the project.

Developers need architectural documentation, coding patterns, PayloadCMS configuration examples, and guidelines for registry distribution of custom components.

## Spec Scope

1. **Interactive Component Documentation** - Create MDX files with live code examples and mock data for all 16 block variants, 17 field types, and motion primitives
2. **Fumadocs Navigation Structure** - Organize documentation into logical categories (Blocks, Fields, Globals, Developer Guides) with proper sidebar navigation
3. **Registry Integration Guide** - Create comprehensive setup documentation for external projects using the custom shadcn registry
4. **Admin Panel Integration** - Document PayloadCMS admin interfaces with screenshots and configuration examples, linking to live admin routes
5. **Developer Contribution Guides** - Create detailed guides for adding custom blocks, fields, and globals with architectural patterns and best practices

## Out of Scope

- Creating new components or blocks (focus only on documenting existing ones)
- Modifying existing component functionality
- Setting up new Fumadocs infrastructure (leveraging existing setup)
- Creating visual design assets or custom illustrations

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete /content/docs directory structure with MDX files for all components, organized by category with proper Fumadocs navigation
2. Live code examples embedded in documentation using MDX components with realistic mock data and TypeScript definitions
3. Registry setup guide with components.json configuration examples and troubleshooting for external project integration
