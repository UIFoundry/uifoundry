## Overview

Create comprehensive documentation for the Custom Header Block system and related components recently added to UIFoundry. This documentation will cover the main Custom Header block, its three sub-components (BrandLogo, MenuButton, MenuItems), the UserAvatar component, and utility functions, ensuring users can effectively implement and customize the flexible header system.

## User Stories

### Developer Documentation Story

As a developer using UIFoundry, I want to understand how to implement and customize the Custom Header Block system, so that I can create professional headers with flexible layouts and responsive behavior for my projects.

The developer needs clear examples of how to configure the main Custom Header block, how to use the sub-components for building custom layouts, and how to leverage the three-column positioning system with mobile responsiveness.

### Component Integration Story

As a content creator using the PayloadCMS admin panel, I want to understand how to use the Custom Header blocks to build headers, so that I can create professional navigation structures without technical knowledge.

The content creator needs guidance on how the nested block system works, how to position elements in left/center/right areas, and how mobile menu behavior functions.

### Registry Installation Story

As a developer installing UIFoundry components via the registry, I want clear installation and usage instructions for all header-related components, so that I can quickly integrate them into my existing projects.

The developer needs documentation for installing each component separately and understanding their dependencies and configuration options.

## Spec Scope

1. **Custom Header Block Documentation** - Complete guide for the main CustomHeaderBlock with layout options, responsive behavior, and scroll effects
2. **Sub-Component Documentation** - Individual documentation for BrandLogo, MenuButton, and MenuItems blocks with configuration examples
3. **UserAvatar Component Documentation** - Usage guide for the UserAvatar component with Better Auth integration
4. **Utility Function Documentation** - Documentation for the getInitials() utility function
5. **Navigation Integration** - Update meta.json files to include all new documentation pages in the site navigation

## Expected Deliverable

1. Five new MDX documentation files in content/docs/ with live examples and configuration guides
2. Updated meta.json navigation files to include all new documentation pages
3. Documentation site successfully builds and renders all new pages with proper navigation
