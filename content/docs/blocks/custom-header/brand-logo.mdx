This component is designed to work as a nested block within the Custom Header:

```tsx
// Used within Custom Header's three-column layout
<RenderBlocks
  blocks={(items ?? []).filter((i) => i.alignment === "left")}
  blockComponents={blockComponents}
/>
```

The alignment prop determines which column the logo appears in:

- `alignment="right"` - Right column
