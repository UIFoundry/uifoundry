## Props

The Footer_4 block accepts the following props from PayloadCMS:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    copyright: {
      type: "string",
      required: false,
      description: "Copyright text displayed in the footer",
      default: "UIFoundry, All rights reserved"
    },
    links: {
      type: "Array<LinkItem>",
      required: false,
      description: "An array of navigation links displayed inline (see LinkItem structure below)",
    },
  }}

      required: true,
    },
