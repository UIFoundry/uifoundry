## Dependencies

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - React framework for production

## Design Notes

**Video Source Priority:**
The component prioritizes video sources in this order:
1. **Light variant** from media upload field
2. **Dark variant** from media upload field
3. **URL fallback** from videoUrl field

This allows you to provide theme-specific videos (recommended) or a single fallback URL.

**Video Background Behavior:**
- Light mode: 50% opacity with color inversion (when using URL fallback)
- Dark mode: 35% opacity on mobile, 75% on desktop with no inversion
- When using media uploads, the appropriate variant displays without color manipulation

**Responsive Layout:**
- Mobile (< 1024px): Centered text with 2:3 aspect ratio video
- Desktop (â‰¥ 1024px): Left-aligned text with 16:9 aspect ratio video

**Performance Tips:**
- **Preferred approach**: Upload optimized videos via media field for best theme support
- Keep video files under 5MB for optimal loading performance
- Use MP4 format for best browser compatibility
- Consider using a CDN for video hosting (like the default ImageKit URL for fallback)
- Compress videos before uploading to reduce file size

**Accessibility:**
- Video includes `muted`, `autoPlay`, `loop`, and `playsInline` attributes for proper behavior
- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards in both themes
