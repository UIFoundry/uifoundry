## Design Notes

**Badge Component:**
The badge includes both a label (styled with muted background) and main text, connected with a separator and arrow icon. It's clickable and links to a customizable URL.

**Email Form:**
- Inline email input with mail icon
- Responsive submit button (shows text on desktop, icon on mobile)
- Form has focus states with ring styling
- Includes form validation attributes for email input

**Features List:**
- Displays as an unordered list with bullet points
- Automatically renders from the features array
- Each feature is a simple text item

**Background Image:**
- Positioned absolutely to cover the entire section
- Includes gradient overlay for better text contrast
- Radial gradient positioned at 65% horizontal, 25% vertical
- Automatically switches between light/dark variants based on theme

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Mobile: Centered text with full-width form
- Desktop: Left-aligned content with background extending to right side
- Form adapts to show full button text on larger screens

**Performance Tips:**
- Optimize background images (recommended 2796x2008px)
- Keep background images under 500KB for fast loading
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP with fallback)
- Consider lazy loading for background images
