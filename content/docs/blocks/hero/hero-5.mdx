## Design Notes

**FlickeringGrid Background:**
- Canvas-based animation with customizable grid parameters
- Default settings: 4px squares, 6px gap, blue color (#60A5FA)
- Circular mask (450px radius) for focused effect
- Max opacity of 50% with 10% flicker chance
- 800x800px rendering area

**Alert Banner:**
- Smooth hover transitions with background color change
- Animated arrow icon with sliding effect
- Muted background with subtle shadow
- Only displays when both label and link are provided

**Text Animations:**
- Header: Word-by-word fade-in blur effect
- Subheader: Line-by-line animation with 0.5s delay
- Custom speed segment of 0.3s for smooth transitions

**CTA Buttons:**
- Staggered entrance animations (0.05s between)
- Primary button with gradient border wrapper
- Secondary button with ghost variant
- Both use spring animations with 0.3 bounce

**Hero Image Frame:**
- Decorative rounded frame with shadow effects
- Ring and inset shadow for depth
- Gradient overlay (35% to 100% opacity)
- Responsive aspect ratio (15:8)
- Centered with max-width constraint

**Fallback Behavior:**
When no media is provided, displays a down arrow with smooth scroll functionality to guide users to the next section.

**Animation Timing:**
- Container delay: 1s before children animate
- Alert/buttons: 0.75s delay with stagger
- All animations use spring physics with 0.3 bounce
- Duration of 1.5-2s for smooth, natural motion

**Responsive Layout:**
- Mobile: Centered text, stacked buttons
- Desktop: Maintains center alignment, buttons side-by-side
- FlickeringGrid scales appropriately across breakpoints
- Image frame adjusts with negative margins on mobile

**Performance Considerations:**
- FlickeringGrid uses efficient canvas rendering
- Animations use hardware acceleration
- Images load with appropriate dimensions (2700x1440 recommended)
- Component only renders animations when in viewport
